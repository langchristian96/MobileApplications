# Shopping List Manager

There will be shopping lists shared between users. Anyone can create a new shopping lists. Anyone can add items to any shopping list.
There will be charts to see the most expensive products bought (when you add a new product to the shopping list). Each user can add items to a shopping list if that list was shared with him or if the user owns the shopping list.
Whenever a new item is added to the shopping list, a mail is sent to the owner of the shopping list.

Regular user:
The regular user can add other products from the list of predefined products. This product will be automatically added to the predefined list of products. 

Admin:
The admin will have almost all the same rights as the regular user, but he will also be able to see all the shopping lists, delete any of them, and delete any of the predefined products in case some user adds some incorrect product.
