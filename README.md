# Shopping List Manager

There will be shopping lists shared between users. Anyone can create a new shopping lists. Anyone can add items to any shopping list.
There will be charts to see the most expensive products bought (when you add a new product to the shopping list, you need a specify an approximate price). Each user can add items to a shopping list if that list was shared with him or if the user owns the shopping list.
Whenever a new item is added to the shopping list, a mail is sent to the owner of the shopping list.
